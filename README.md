# 💼 High Salary Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project predicts whether an individual earns a **high salary (1)** or **low salary (0)** based on demographic, educational, and occupational data.  
The goal is to compare several machine learning models and determine which performs best for salary classification.

## 🧩 1. Project Overview
- **Dataset size:** 20,900 census records  
- **Original features:** 18  
- **Processed variables:** 49 (after encoding and scaling)  
- **Target variable:** `label` → 1 = High Salary, 0 = Low Salary  

### Objective
To develop, train, and evaluate multiple machine learning models — including **Random Forest**, **XGboots**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** — for accurate salary prediction.

## ⚙️ 2. Tools and Libraries
- **Languages:** Python 3.11  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `json`  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (Docker / VS Code)

## 🧹 3. Data Preparation
1. **Data Loading** – Read train, test, and live datasets  
2. **Handle Missing Values** – Mode for categorical, mean for numerical  
3. **Encoding** – Ordinal for `education`, One-Hot for `workclass`, `occupation`, `relationship`, `sex`  
4. **Feature Scaling** – Standardized numeric features (`StandardScaler`)  
5. **Integration** – Combined all processed data → final train/test/live CSVs  
6. **Final Output** – 49 ready-to-use modeling features

## 💬 6. Discussion and Reflection

### **Trade-offs**
- ANN offers high accuracy but requires longer training and less interpretability.  
- Tree-based models (Random Forest) are easier to explain but slightly less accurate.  

### **Overfitting**
- Minimal risk observed; model reached the iteration limit, suggesting slight underfitting.  
- Future models can apply **early stopping** or **regularization** to improve convergence.

### **Limitations**
- Encoded categorical ranges (e.g., age-group 0–4) may oversimplify data.  
- Mean/mode imputation may introduce minor bias.  
- ANN lacks transparency for feature influence.

### **Improvements**
- Apply **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Use **dropout** or **L2 regularization** to avoid overfitting.  
- Test deeper ANN architectures or **XGBoost**.  
- Add **SHAP/LIME** for interpretability.

## 🏁 8. Conclusion
The ANN achieved the **highest accuracy (84%)**, outperforming both Random Forest and Logistic Regression.  
It effectively classified high-income individuals using demographic and occupational features, though further tuning and interpretability improvements are recommended for real-world use.
